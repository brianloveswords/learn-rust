# Sum square difference

## Problem statement
```
The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
(1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
```

## Initial thoughts

This one seems pretty straightwards: `count`, `map` and `fold`.

## First solution

Nothing terribly interesting about this solution!

```rust
use std::iter::count;

fn main() {
    let amount = 100;

    let sum_of_squares = count(1u, 1)
        .take(amount)
        .map(square)
        .fold(0, sum_accum);

    let sums = count(1u, 1)
        .take(amount)
        .fold(0, sum_accum);

    let square_of_sums = sums * sums;

    println!("sum of squares: {}", sum_of_squares);
    println!("square of sums: {}", square_of_sums);
    println!("difference: {}", square_of_sums - sum_of_squares);
}
fn square(n: uint) -> uint { n * n }
fn sum_accum(a: uint, x: uint) -> uint { a + x }
```
