# Learning rust by blindly stumbling through Project Euler

I'm trying get a handle on Rust. I went through the tutorial and some of the guides, but the best way to learn is by actually making stuff so I'm gonna try to go through as many [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems as I can.

I will also be taking a lot of notes about my thought process as I find solutions and incrementally improve them. Hopefully this will help inform what's for the new Rust tutorial & documentation from a novice's perspective.

## Background

My programming background is almost entirely as a web developer, using dynamic languages. I did a short stint in bioinformatics from 2005-2006, where I had to modify small amounts of C, but other than that my professional career has been dominated by Python, Ruby and JavaScript. In particular, I've worked on node.js pretty exclusively since 2011.

Over the years I have spent some hobby time with various lisps (Emacs is my co-pilot), as well as Haskell and Erlang, and I prefer functional paradigm to OO, and I've never had to program Java, so at least I won't have to unlearn a bunch of shit.
